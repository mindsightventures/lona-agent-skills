## Conventions

- **Skill names** use the `lona-` prefix (e.g., `lona-trading-strategy`).
- **Skills** live in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- **Rules** live in `rules/<rule-name>.mdc` (Cursor-specific).
- **Commands** live in `commands/<command-name>.md`.
- **Agents** live in `agents/<agent-name>.md`.
- **SKILL.md files** must include YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`.
- **Tool references** use backtick-wrapped names (e.g., `lona_list_strategies`).
- **Markdown** should be clean, well-structured, and free of unnecessary formatting.

## Platform Compatibility

This plugin supports both Claude Code and Cursor:

| Component | Claude Code | Cursor |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Skills (`skills/`) | Auto-discovered | Via `plugin.json` path |
| Rules (`rules/`) | N/A | Via `plugin.json` path |
| Commands (`commands/`) | Supported | Supported |
| Agents (`agents/`) | Supported | Supported |
| MCP (`.mcp.json`) | Supported | Supported |

When adding new components, ensure they work on both platforms by following the directory conventions above.
